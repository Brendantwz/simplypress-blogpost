<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project :brain:

<h3>Why this project?</h3>
Honestly, it is a random thought project that came across to me when I was browsing through "Medium Blogpost". <br>
It occured to me that, <b>"Do blogpost writer usually write down a mock up before they publish the finalized version? :thinking:"</b> and the rest is history. <br>
<br>
Eventually, this project as a testing ground for me since, I freshly learnt about Node.js and Express.js. 

<h3>What did I learn?</h3>
This project may not be exceptional but I encounter troubles and thought process going through this project. Here are the few key pointers
<br>
<br>

<b>Key takeaways lessons I picked up from this project:</b>
* Google or ChatGPT is your friend :left_speech_bubble: - knowing how to <b>prompt</b> a question will be super helpful in resolving your trouble
* Use framework or libraries :books: - coding natively is cool but it is not time-efficient. Be efficient.
* Always be asking "why" and have breakpoints  - nothing appear out of thin air. Segmenting your codes cleanly allow you to debug effectively. (will save you so much time and headaches! :warning:)
* Do not dwell on a problem too long :bed: - know when to call it stop. Take a short break if you need to. Staring at a problem while having a brain fog will not automatically solve it
* Breakdown big task into smaller ones :pinching_hand: - it is overwhelming to just take on big task. Always start with 1 feature at a time. You will see better delivery and progress in the project without overwhelming yourself

Of course, there are more but these are the few key ones that I felt will resonate with me and hopefully you throughout your development endeavour!<br>
<br>
If you find this helpful and would love to contribute or work with it. Feel free to drop a star!
